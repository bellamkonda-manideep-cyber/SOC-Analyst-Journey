## SOC Fundamentals – TryHackMe

### Overview

This repository documents my learning from the SOC Fundamentals room on [TryHackMe SOC Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/room/socfundamentals?utm_campaign=social_share&utm_medium=social&utm_content=share-completed-room&utm_source=copy&sharerId=66ae5e8b243b63afc413148f).
The room introduces the core concepts of a Security Operations Center (SOC), focusing on people, processes, and technology used to detect and respond to security incidents.

<br>

### Objectives of This Room:-

* Understand what a Security Operations Center (SOC) is

* Learn SOC team roles and responsibilities

* Understand alert triage and escalation

* Get exposure to real-world SOC workflows

* Build a strong foundation for SOC Analyst (L1) roles

<br>

### Key Learnings
#### What is a SOC?

A SOC is a centralized team responsible for:

* Monitoring security alerts

* Detecting suspicious activity

* Investigating incidents

* Escalating threats to reduce business impact

*The SOC acts as the first line of defense for an organization.*

<br>

### SOC Pillars – People, Process, Technology
#### People

I learned about SOC roles such as:

* SOC Analyst (L1) – Alert monitoring and initial triage

* SOC Analyst (L2) – Deep investigation and correlation

* SOC Analyst (L3) – Advanced threat hunting and response

* SOC Manager & Engineers – Strategy, tooling, and operations

*Each role plays a critical part in incident detection and response.*

<br> 

### Process

#### SOC processes ensure:

* Alerts are analyzed consistently

* Incidents are documented

* Proper escalation happens on time

#### Key processes include:

* Alert triage

* Incident classification

* Escalation procedures

* Incident response lifecycle

<br>

### Technology

SOC teams rely on tools such as:

* SIEM platforms

* Log analysis tools

* Endpoint and network monitoring systems

*These tools help analysts quickly identify anomalies and investigate threats.*

<br>

### Alert Triage & Escalation

I learned how SOC analysts:

* Identify false positives vs real threats

* Analyze logs for suspicious behavior

* Decide when to escalate an alert

* Understand the business impact of incidents

*This is a core skill for SOC L1 analysts.*

<br>

### Practical Exposure

#### Through scenario-based tasks, I practiced:

* Reading and understanding alerts

* Recognizing unauthorized login attempts

* Deciding whether an alert needs escalation

* Thinking like a SOC analyst in real environments

<br>

### Outcome

After completing this room, I gained:

* Clear understanding of SOC operations

* Confidence in alert triage concepts

* Strong foundation for SOC Analyst L1 roles

* Readiness to move into hands-on SOC labs

  <br>

*This repository reflects my learning journey and understanding.*
