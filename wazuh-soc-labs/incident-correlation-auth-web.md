## Incident Correlation: Web Reconnaissance & SSH Brute-Force (Wazuh SIEM)
### Incident Overview

This investigation documents a correlated security incident identified through multiple alerts generated by Wazuh SIEM. The alerts, when analyzed together, revealed a single coordinated attack attempt progressing through reconnaissance and authentication attack stages.

---
### Alerts Involved

#### Web Reconnaissance Alert

* Rule Description: Web server 400 error code

* Activity: Repeated requests to non-existent and sensitive web paths

* Source: Kali Linux endpoint

#### SSH Brute-Force Alert

* Rule Description: SSH authentication failure / brute-force detection

* Activity: Multiple failed SSH login attempts targeting a non-existent user

* Source: Kali Linux endpoint

---
### Timeline of Events

* Initial activity involved repeated HTTP requests to non-existent and sensitive URLs such as /admin, /wp-admin, and random paths.

* Within a short time window, SSH authentication failures were observed from the same system.

* The sequence of events occurred within the same monitoring period, indicating continuity in attacker behavior.

---
### Correlation Analysis

* Both web and authentication alerts originated from the same endpoint.

* Events occurred within a short and continuous time window.

* Alert sequence matched a common attack progression:
  * Reconnaissance (web scanning and probing)

  * Authentication attack (SSH brute-force attempts)

* The behavior indicates a single attacker attempting to identify potential entry points before attempting system access.

---
### Incident Classification

* Classification: Single Correlated Security Incident

* Reason: Multiple alerts represent different stages of the same attack attempt rather than separate, unrelated incidents.

---
### Analyst Notes

* Observed repeated web reconnaissance activity followed by SSH brute-force attempts originating from the same system within a short time frame. The sequence and correlation of alerts indicate a single coordinated attack attempt progressing from reconnaissance to authentication attack. Escalated as one incident for further investigation and response.

---
### Learning Outcome

* Learned how to correlate multiple alerts into a single security incident

* Gained understanding of common attack progression patterns

* Practiced SOC L1 incident classification and documentation

* Improved ability to analyze attacker behavior across different log sources
